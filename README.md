## 🚀 Installation - Let's Get This Party Started! 🥳

### Local Setup - Your Own Coding Den 🏠

1.  **Clone the Mothership 🛸:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Don't forget to use your actual repo link!
    cd CodeX
    ```

2.  **Whip up a Virtual Environment 🪄:**
    *   On Windows (like a wizard casting a spell!):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux (the penguin way! 🐧):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the Goodies 🍬 (Python dependencies):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    *(Psst! If `requirements.txt` is playing hide and seek, you might need to create it first with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your project's direct dependencies.)*

4.  **Database Dance 💃🕺 (Apply migrations):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Launch the Rocket! 🚀 (Run the development server):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and behold the awesomeness! ✨

### Docker Setup - Containerize and Conquer! 🚢

1.  **Build the Docker Spaceship 🏗️:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t codex-app .
    ```
    *(Make sure your `Dockerfile` is ready for launch!)*

2.  **Blast Off! 🚀 (Run the Docker container):**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 codex-app
    ```
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser. Houston, we have a running app! 🧑‍🚀
    *(Heads up! The `build_docker_image.sh` script might have some secret launch codes 🤫)*

### Render Setup - Deploy to the Cloud! ☁️

1.  **Create a Render Account:**
    Sign up at [Render](https://render.com/) if you don't already have an account.

2.  **Connect Your GitHub Repository:**
    Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account in Render and select your CodeX repository.

3.  **Create a New Web Service:**
    - Click on "New" and select "Web Service"
    - Select your repository
    - Render will automatically detect the configuration in your `render.yaml` file
    - Click "Create"

4.  **Watch the Magic Happen:**
    Render will automatically deploy your application based on the configurations in your `render.yaml` file. It will:
    - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
    - Run the build script `build.sh`
    - Start the application with gunicorn
    - Provision a PostgreSQL database

5.  **Access Your Deployed App:**
    Once the deployment is complete, click on the URL provided by Render to access your live application!

## 🎮 Usage - How to Play 🕹️

1.  Surf 🏄 to the application in your web browser.
2.  Sign up for a new mission (account) or log in if you're a returning astronaut 🧑‍🚀.
3.  Craft new code snippets, pick your language, write your masterpiece 🎨, and hit RUN!
4.  Stash your gems 💎 (snippets) in your dashboard.
5.  Share your creations with the universe 🌌 using the generated links.
